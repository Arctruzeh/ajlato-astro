name: "Calculator"
description: "PHP calculator using OOP. For demonstration purposes only."
detailedDescription: "This calculator application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in PHP. Unlike typical calculator implementations, this project focuses on clean architecture, with separate classes handling different calculation operations, input validation, and output formatting."

features: 
  - "Support for basic arithmetic operations"
  - "Memory functions for storing and recalling values"
  - "Comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs"

dateCreated: "November 2023"
challenges: "Designing a truly object-oriented calculator required careful consideration of class responsibilities and interactions. Ensuring mathematical operations handled edge cases correctly (division by zero, floating-point precision issues) while maintaining clean code organization was particularly challenging."
solutions: "I implemented a Strategy pattern for different operations, allowing for easy extension with new mathematical functions. A dedicated validation layer prevents invalid calculations, and custom exception classes provide meaningful error messages. The project uses dependency injection to improve testability."
