dateCreated: "July 2019 (Refactored 2026)"
challenges: "The primary challenge was modernizing a legacy concept to meet contemporary standards. Implementing strict typing and Enums required a rigorous approach to data validation. Additionally, creating custom, accessible form controls (like the select dropdown and number spinners) without relying on third-party libraries presented significant UX complexities."
solutions: "I engineered a `Calc` class using PHP 8's constructor property promotion and union types for concise, robust logic. The `match` expression replaced verbose switch statements. For the frontend, I built custom JavaScript components that maintain accessibility (ARIA) while delivering a polished visual aesthetic, ensuring form inputs behave intuitively on both desktop and mobile."
