challenges: "The main goal was to transition from writing procedural PHP scripts to thinking in terms of objects and classes. Understanding how to instantiate a class and methods from a separate file was the primary learning objective."
solutions: "I created a dedicated `Calc` class in a separate file and used PHP's `include` statement to bring it into the main script. The class acts as a blueprint for the calculator, with a method that switches between different operations based on user input."
