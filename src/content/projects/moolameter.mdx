dateCreated: "2024 - Present"
challenges: "One of the primary challenges was building a real-time projection engine that could accurately reflect the impact of scheduled bills and irregular income on future account balances, while simultaneously calculating complex tax withholdings for multiple income types."
solutions: "I implemented a robust projection algorithm in Laravel that processes recurrence rules and tax logic server-side, then delivers the data through Inertia.js to a responsive React frontend. Using Chart.js, I created interactive visualizations that allow users to explore their financial future day-by-day."
questions: 
  - q: "Can I afford this purchase?"
    a: "Check the 30-day projection to see the impact on your future balance."
  - q: "How much will I owe in taxes?"
    a: "The annual tax estimate provides real-time calculations based on your income."
  - q: "Where does my money go?"
    a: "Organized categories and historical data provide a clear breakdown of spending."
  - q: "Which card gives me the most cash back?"
    a: "The credit card optimizer recommends the best card based on the current purchase category."
  - q: "When will I run out of money?"
    a: "Cash flow projections highlight potential low-balance points well in advance."
