challenges: "The main challenge was coordinating multiple API calls efficiently while ensuring the background image thematically matched the generated text. Additionally, handling potential API failures gracefully without disrupting the user experience required careful error handling."
solutions: "I implemented async/await patterns with proper error handling to manage API requests. For theme matching, I developed an algorithm that analyzes key terms in the generated text and sends relevant search queries to the Pixabay API to find a relevant background image."
