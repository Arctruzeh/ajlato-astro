name: "FizzBuzz"
description: "A standard PHP implementation of the classic FizzBuzz interview question."
detailedDescription: "This project is a straightforward implementation of the FizzBuzz algorithm using PHP. It iterates numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs 'Fizz', 'Buzz', or 'FizzBuzz' based on divisibility rules, serving as a fundamental example of conditional logic and loops in PHP."

technologies: 
  - "PHP"
  - "HTML"
features: 
  - "Logic implementation using `for` loops and `if/elseif` statements"
  - "Modulo operator usage for divisibility checks"
  - "Simple HTML output"
dateCreated: "July 2019"
challenges: "The challenge was to understand the logic flow where the condition for 'FizzBuzz' (divisible by both 3 and 5) must be checked before the individual checks for 3 or 5."
solutions: "I used string concatenation to build the output variable `$y`, appending 'Fizz' and 'Buzz' independently. This allows the code to naturally handle the 'FizzBuzz' case without a redundant third condition."
