name: "FizzBuzz (Ultimate Edition)"
description: "An over-engineered, industrial-grade benchmark suite for the classic FizzBuzz interview question."
detailedDescription: "This is not your average FizzBuzz. It is a high-performance benchmarking laboratory that compares 5+ different algorithmic strategies (including PHP 8 Match, Pre-computation, and Bitwise operations). It features a cyberpunk/industrial UI, real-time millisecond execution timing, and a responsive mobile dashboard for on-the-go performance analysis."

technologies: 
  - "PHP 8.2"
  - "JavaScript (ES6)"
  - "CSS3 (Grid/Flexbox)"
  - "HTML5"
features: 
  - "Multi-Strategy Benchmarking: Compare execution speeds of 5 diverse algorithms"
  - "Real-time Visualization: Interactive terminal output with execution stats"
  - "Premium Mobile UX: Custom mobile strategy navigation and automated benchmark reporting"
  - "Industrial Design: Custom cyberpunk aesthetics with CSS-only textures"
dateCreated: "July 2019"
challenges: "Transforming a trivial 5-minute task into a robust, extensible performance analysis tool while ensuring the UI remained responsive and engaging across all device sizes."
solutions: "I implemented a modular 'Strategy' pattern in PHP to easily plug in new algorithms. The frontend uses vanilla JS to handle asynchronous benchmarks without reloading. For mobile, I created a custom navigation system that auto-reveals the sidebar menu upon benchmark completion to maximize screen real estate."
