name: "FizzBuzz"
description: "Count from 1 to 100, outputing fizz when divisible by 3, buzz when divisible by 5, and fizzbuzz when both are true."
detailedDescription: "My implementation of the classic FizzBuzz programming challenge features an interactive visualization that brings the algorithm to life. While seemingly simple, this project demonstrates clean code principles, algorithmic thinking, and creative front-end presentation of a common programming exercise."

dateCreated: "March 2023"
challenges: "While the FizzBuzz algorithm itself is straightforward, creating an engaging and interactive visualization presented unique challenges. The project needed to be both educational for programming beginners and interesting for experienced developers."
solutions: "I implemented a staged reveal animation that helps users visualize how the algorithm evaluates each number. The interface allows users to customize parameters, demonstrating how small changes affect the output. Code samples in various languages provide educational value for developers learning new syntax."
