dateCreated: "July 2019"
challenges: "The primary challenge was ensuring the security of user data. Understanding how to properly hash passwords instead of storing them in plain text, and preventing SQL injection attacks were key learning points."
solutions: "I utilized PHP's built-in `password_hash` function to securely store credentials and used MySQLi prepared statements (`$stmt->prepare`) to separate SQL logic from data, effectively neutralizing SQL injection risks."
