challenges: "Creating a comprehensive question database that covered various linguistic edge cases was time-consuming. Additionally, designing an algorithm that would present questions in an optimal learning sequence rather than purely random order required careful consideration."
solutions: "I developed a tagging system for questions to categorize them by difficulty and linguistic rules. This allowed for implementing a spaced repetition algorithm that presents challenging questions more frequently while gradually introducing new concepts. User performance data is stored locally to personalize the learning experience."
